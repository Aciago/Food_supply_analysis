### :muscle: Learning goals:
- clusterization algorithms
- statistical tests and law of adequacy
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

### :briefcase: Scenario:
Our food processing company wishes to expand internationally. It's specialization is chicken meat! For the moment the field of possibilities is quite large: no particular country or continent is chosen. All countries are possible! Our objective is to help target certain countries in particular, in order to deepen the market study later. More specifically, the ideal would be to produce "groups" of countries, more or less large, whose characteristics we know. Initially, the strategy is to export the products rather than to produce them locally, i.e. in the new targeted country(ies).

### :package: Dataset:
Our dataset is a [historical records about global food supply provided by United Nations](https://www.fao.org/faostat/fr/#data). We download those CSV reports  that correspond to our objectives.
